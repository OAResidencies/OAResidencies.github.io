# Oberrō Artist-run Residencies (OARs)

## **About**

OARs are art residencies run by the participating artists themselves. The aim of OARs is to become a space where artists from different backgrounds and regions can meet and engage with each other, without a pre-determined setting. 

The structures of each residency are shaped by the artists and as the group is formed. The location, themes, projects, activities and formats of each residency are then proposed and developed on a case-base process, shaped by the needs and interests of each particular group and scenario. 

In OARs, artists can develop their projects independently and/or propose projects collaboratively. The focus is on the communal aspect of the residency, where spaces, tools and knowledge can be shared. 

OARs is a project developed through [Oberrō](https://oberro.github.io/)
